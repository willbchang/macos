*Install [[https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv][Ruby environment]]*\\
Use rbenv to pick a Ruby version for your application and guarantee that your development environment matches production. Put rbenv to work with Bundler for painless Ruby upgrades and bulletproof deployments.

Well, you just cannot install ~rails~ correctly with ~brew install ruby~, that's why I use ~rbenv~.
#+begin_src sh
brew install rbenv
#+end_src

*Initialize rbenv*
#+begin_src sh
rbenv init
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
#+end_src

*Install latest stable Ruby*
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/30191850
#+begin_src sh
latest_ruby_version=$(rbenv install -l | grep -v - | tail -1)
rbenv install $latest_ruby_version
rbenv rehash
rbenv global $latest_ruby_version
#+end_src
