# Trash

[macos-trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/macos-trash) is a safe deletion tool in contrast to [rm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rm_(Unix)) which is dangerous and permanently delete files, this only moves them to the trash, which is much safer and reversible.

```bash
brew install macos-trash
```
